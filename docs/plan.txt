-Data:

- Get segment data for drio.
- render segment data on map with leaflet
- get weather data for location.
- visualize winds for a particular moment in time
- combine wind data + segments for a particular time 


Make things dynamic so you have segments for a particular user. 

Alternatively, get all segments for a particular location and update 
periodically the visualization. 

So: 

show me all segments in a location and tell me which ones are ideal to ride
to get comes given the weather conditions for a particular time.
