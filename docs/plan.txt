- items:

+ load all segments
+ position the map so we see all the segments (perhaps not necessary)
+ load weather data
+ how do we use the weather data (wind) and the segment data (polyline) to 
  determine how ideal a segment is for a PR attempt.

+ Given a polyline, determine the direction of the sublines:
  *----NE----*-----SOUTH----* ....

  Algorith:
  INPUT: (polyline(segment), wind speed, wind direction (angle), ..... dry or wet?)
  ---
  Per each subsegment:
    - compute angle direction
    - compute distance
  Compute angle difference on each subsegment (absolute value)
    90
    [100m, 200m, 300m, 100m, .....]    
    [82, 80, 80, 20, 90    , .....]

-Data:

- Get segment data for drio.
- render segment data on map with leaflet
- get weather data for location.
- visualize winds for a particular moment in time
- combine wind data + segments for a particular time 


Make things dynamic so you have segments for a particular user. 

Alternatively, get all segments for a particular location and update 
periodically the visualization. 

So: 

show me all segments in a location and tell me which ones are ideal to ride
to get comes given the weather conditions for a particular time.
